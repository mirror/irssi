*** Bugs

 - If there's any empty lists in configuration file (like ircnets = ();),
   libPropList crashes irssi at startup.. Irssi doesn't save any empty lists
   now, but still this needs to be fixed in libPropList..
 - after changing irssi-text's screen size to smaller it leaves some empty
   lines to windows before printing text, redrawing screen moves the lines
   back up.. hm..
 - irssi can't find new themes in ~/.irssi/ while running - scan for new
   themes when opening themes dialog? irssi-text also needs to be restarted
   to use new themes..
 - mirc ctcp togglemenuitem isn't updated right
 - multiple dcc connections from different irc networks from same nick
   doesn't work. Maybe create "server nick" and "refer nick" variables to
   DCC_REC?
 - gfloat doesn't work in formats .. why? In DCC messages kb and kb/s values
   could be shown as floats..

*** text GUI

 - statusbar:
     - when starting to run out of space some items could be made smaller,
       activity for example .. make some generic flag for items to use.
     - activity: hilight number if window has message for you or hilighted
       text
     - "you have new mail"
     - active server tag somewhere in window
 - word wrapping doesn't work perfectly, if colors/bolds/etc are used, they're
   treated as spaces. So things like (<newline>blah blah) can happen (/who)

*** Big things

 - keyboard configuration
 - session saving thing.. specify what channels/queries/dcc chats to open in
   which window (real/tabbed/in same window with some other), what irc net
   channels goes to where, what channels/queries to open at startup, etc.
   use dialog with gtktree widget to change it.
 - split windows with gtkpaned (check window-views-patch.diff)
 - really transparently working irc proxy, saves scrollback buffers, etc.
   Or maybe the existing ones already work?
 - some sort of address book? our own irssi ctcp to ask for other irssi users
   for their information (of course not without asking (except optionally))..
   could be nice also to automatically update it, keep track of all seen
   users gathered when joining channels, whois, who, etc. commands.
   automatically updating information could be host masks, nicks, ips, seen in
   channels, operator in channels, .. user specified checks like last topic or
   mode changes or even msgs to you/some channel/with some keyword. great for
   spying people ;) maybe even useful sometimes..

   .. but what database would be best for this?

 - GTK version: icons to toolbars, accelerators to menus
 - Windows style MDI windows are possible with GtkFixed .. Some people would
   like this.. too much job for me, it would need building the MDI windows
   ourself (title bar, borders, resizing, etc.)

 - online help, documentation, ...
 - plugins:
     - perl plugin .. implementation problems, C's structures need to be
       handled some way .. like for server structure get_address(),
       get_port(), set_address(), set_port() etc..
     - other scripting plugins would be easier? scheme, tcl, pythong?
       sula premirex uses scheme, it would probably be pretty easy to learn
       from it how to do it to irssi :)
     - IRC bot, eggdrop is too old, needs a replacement ;)
     - DCC file server, I'm not too excited about this, maybe someone else
       wants to do it..
     - Multiplayer games! :) Chess, tic-tac-toe, othello, battleship, tetris,
       etc. Existing games should probably be used .. though there doesn't
       seem to be any of these (except tetris) for gnome right now..
     - audio / video chat :)

*** Little things

 - command line parameter handling, specify what server/ircnet to autoconnect
   or none.
 - log option: add the open/close time to log
 - log directory, automatically log all channels and queries there
     - overwrite/append
     - all windows, just queries, only the channels in channel list
     - you can be joined to same channels in different irc networks (or even
       the same ircnet!) - create the logs to different directiories/names
 - use different themes in different channels/queries?
 - improve msgslevels and ignoring .. Like ignoring "chan" doesn't work now.
   It could be changed to joins, parts, quits, topics, nicks, .. just rip all
   the msglevels from bitchx and use them :)
 - use server-idle instead of channel.query thing..
 - lag meter
 - possibility to display different colors in nicks from different people..
   and different colors for word hilighting too
 - /connect ircnet could connect to ircnet
 - change some GLists to GHashTables, aliases at least
 - check new irssi versions with http rather than with irssibot..
 - implement requesting files with DCC GET from remote client for dcc file
   servers. good for people behind firewalls.
 - support for ircii translation tables (/usr/lib/irc/translation/*)
 - use different nicks/realnames in different irc networks
 - zvt problems/todo:
    - need some way to disable all the extra features, like sending 0x8e
      messes up your fonts.
    - the ugly cursor just keeps blinking
    - when clicking an empty spot on screen it sometimes tells that there's
      some weird crap in there..
    - word wrapping
     - make window/save buffer and find work
 - notify list:
     - dialog: keep track of hosts/realnames so after closing and opening the
       dialog again they would show up.. 
     - summary list (for irssi-text)
     - nick-specific options: 
        - check for gone-flag changes (use userhosts instead of isons)
        - create popup dialog
	- run some command (like /exec as soon as I get that done :)
 - gnome statubar:
    - clock?
    - dcc transfer meter (gtk progressbar)
 - you could configure which events (whois, notify, etc.) to show in what
   windows (all, current, status)
 - gui for configuring plugin specific theme format texts
 - awaylog (/log create ~/away.log -all +msgs or something), autoaway
 - dcc send: allow selection of multiple files to send (also for dnd from
   gmc!) Allow dropping files to anywhere in irssi.
 - logging: longer format dd.mm.yy hh:mm:ss (configurable?)
 - net split/join detection ? is this even needed? more harmful than useful?
 - /timer, /clones
 - run multiple commands with one alias (what was this needed for? can't
   remember..)
 - regexp for hilighting words?
 - subcommands (dcc, window, ..) could use common function instead of copy and
   pasting the same function all the time and modifying just two words...
